# Tower-Defence-Project

This project is to create a Tower Defence game. It can start very simple, but can be evolved to something much bigger. Tower Defence is a well known game that can be found on many different games such as Starcraft and Warcraft, and also as small/big platform games on the internet. The main scenario is that you can create "towers" that will be able to shoot moving targets that will try to get pass the tower without being destroyed. If too many targets get pass the towers you will lose. There can be different creatures, different towers with upgrades and eventually an interesting map that the objects will move on. 

We will use test-driven development. During the second week will make tests.
